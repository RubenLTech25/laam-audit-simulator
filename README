# LAAM Audit Simulator

The LAAM Audit Simulator is a fairness-aware, emotionally legible tool for exploring how audit decisions evolve over time. Built on the **LTAE** and **LAAM** frameworks, this interactive app models trust, erosion, and redemption across jurisdictions.

## 🔍 What It Does

- Assign signals like `missing_doc`, `clean`, or `legacy_flag`
- Watch belief drift and anchor burden evolve in real time
- Explore override logic and jurisdictional nuance
- Reflect on systemic memory and fairness in enforcement

## 🧭 Jurisdictional Scenarios

Each region interprets signals differently:
- **Florida**: Forgives quickly after resolved errors
- **Chicago**: Remembers legacy flags and escalates
- **Nevada**: Reacts strongly to environmental triggers
- **IRS (default)**: Applies standard audit logic with override thresholds
